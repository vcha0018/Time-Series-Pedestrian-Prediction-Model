# Time-Series-Pedestrian-Prediction-Model
Developed machine learning models (the binary classification and regression using PySpark) to predict pedestrian traffic using the publicly available pedestrian dataset of the city of Melbourne, Australia. the machine learning models would be further integrated into the streaming platform using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark Streaming to perform prediction, to recommend busy locations for street art performers.
